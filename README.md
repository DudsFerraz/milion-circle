# milion-circle

## Made by Eduardo Ferraz.

## This is a project made for my software engineering degree.

### Project description:

### There are N people sitting in a circle. The people are numbered sequentially from 1 to N. In the center of the circle is a billionaire who enjoys giving away millions. He will choose one person to win a million dollars. To do so, he will eliminate N - 1 people from the circle, following two rules:

### The billionaire eliminates one person from the circle and always skips the next one, until only one person remains, who will be the winner of the prize.
### The billionaire always starts by eliminating the person numbered 2.
### For example: Considering N = 1000, the billionaire eliminates person number 2, followed by 4, 6, 8, ..., 996, 998, 1000. At this point, he skips to number 1 and eliminates person number 3, number 7, and so on.

### Given this scenario, create a program that, given the number N of people in the circle, informs:
### The number of the person who will win the prize;
### The number of the x-th person to be eliminated.

### Input and Output Format:

### Input:
### The first line of the program contains an integer N, representing the number of people in the circle. The second line of the program contains an integer X, which represents the x-th person to be eliminated.

### Output:
### The program should output two lines: The first one indicates the x-th person to be eliminated. The second line indicates the number of the person who will win the prize.
